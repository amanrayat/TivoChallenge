# TivoChallenge


To complete this challenge I have used the Charts.js Library. 

I have made the WebPage where you first select the Date (Starting from today) and then click on Done. 
The chart will be generated showing the Length for Every Date that was provided. 
The Lengths are color coded according to the Names.

The legend shows the Name and corresponding colors. 

X-axis signifies the Days and The Y-axis shows the corresponding Length. 

I also Included the "Active Data" button and "Full Data" button. Clicking on the Active data will give us the graph for data which has active set as true. Clicking on the "Full Data" will give us the complete data. By default All data is set. 

To Show the values of Tango, India , Victor and Oscar, I have created other graphs which also varies in accordance with the Date. 

If We select different month, different data will be produced and new graphs will be rendered.
